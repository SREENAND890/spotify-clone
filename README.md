This is a basic Spotify Clone built using only HTML and CSS. It’s a static frontend project created as part of a mini project to practice web design skills.
The layout is inspired by the official Spotify web app, featuring a sidebar, top navigation, playlist section, and a music player at the bottom.

The project does not include any real music streaming functionality or JavaScript-based interactions. It’s purely for design and layout purposes.
This clone helped me improve my understanding of page structure, styling, and responsive layout techniques using HTML and CSS.
